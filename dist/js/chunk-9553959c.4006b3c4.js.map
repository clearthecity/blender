I know not how it was--but, with the\\nfirst glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\\npervaded my spirit.  I say insufferable; for the feeling was\\nunrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic,\\nsentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\\nnatural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon the\\nscene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\\nfeatures of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant\\neye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white\\ntrunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I\\ncan compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\\nafter-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into\\neveryday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was\\nan iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed\\ndreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could\\ntorture into aught of the sublime.  What was it--I paused to\\nthink--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of\\nthe House of Usher?  It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I\\ngrapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I\\npondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory\\nconclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations\\nof very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\\naffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\\nconsiderations beyond our depth.  It was possible, I reflected,\\nthat a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the\\nscene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to\\nmodify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful\\nimpression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse\\nto the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in\\nunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a\\nshudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and\\ninverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems,\\nand the vacant and eye-like windows.\\n\\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to\\nmyself a sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,\\nhad been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had\\nelapsed since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had lately\\nreached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from\\nhim--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no\\nother than a personal reply.  The MS gave evidence of nervous\\nagitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental\\ndisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me,\\nas his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of\\nattempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation\\nof his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and much\\nmore, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his\\nrequest--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I\\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very\\nsingular summons.\\n\\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet\\nI really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been always\\nexcessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his very\\nancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar\\nsensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,\\nin many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in\\nrepeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as\\nin a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more\\nthan to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical\\nscience.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\\nstem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put\\nforth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that\\nthe entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had\\nalways, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.\\nIt was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\\nthought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with\\nthe accredited character of the people, and while speculating\\nupon the possible influence which the one, in the long\\nlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was\\nthis deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent\\nundeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with\\nthe name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\\nappellation of the \\\"House of Usher\\\"--an appellation which seemed\\nto include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the\\nfamily and the family mansion.\\n\\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\\nexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to\\ndeepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that\\nthe consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for\\nwhy should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the\\nincrease itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law\\nof all sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might have\\nbeen for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to\\nthe house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my\\nmind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but\\nmention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which\\noppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really to\\nbelieve that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an\\natmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an\\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but\\nwhich had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall,\\nand the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull,\\nsluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\\n\\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream,\\nI scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its\\nprincipal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.\\nThe discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi\\noverspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work\\nfrom the eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary\\ndilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there\\nappeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\\nadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the\\nindividual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me of\\nthe specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long\\nyears in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the\\nbreath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication of\\nextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of\\ninstability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might\\nhave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending\\nfrom the roof of the building in front, made its way down the\\nwall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen\\nwaters of the tarn.\\n\\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the\\nhouse.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the\\nGothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence\\nconducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate\\npassages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Much\\nthat I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to\\nheighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.\\nWhile the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,\\nthe sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the\\nfloors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\\nI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had\\nbeen accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to\\nacknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find\\nhow unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were\\nstirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician of\\nthe family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled\\nexpression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with\\ntrepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and\\nushered me into the presence of his master.\\n\\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.\\nThe windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a\\ndistance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible\\nfrom within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way\\nthrough the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently\\ndistinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,\\nstruggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or\\nthe recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies\\nhung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse,\\ncomfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical\\ninstruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality\\nto the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.\\nAn air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and\\npervaded all.\\n\\nUpon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had\\nbeen lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth\\nwhich had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone\\ncordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of\\nthe world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me\\nof his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments,\\nwhile he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity,\\nhalf of awe.  Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,\\nin so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was with\\ndifficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the\\nman being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.  Yet\\nthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  A\\ncadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\\nbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\\nsurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,\\nbut with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\\nfinely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a\\nwant of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\\ntenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the\\nregions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not\\neasily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the\\nprevailing character of these features, and of the expression\\nthey were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to\\nwhom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\\nmiraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even\\nawed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all\\nunheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather\\nthan fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\\nits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\\n\\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an\\nincoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise\\nfrom a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an\\nhabitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  For\\nsomething of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by\\nhis letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and\\nby conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation\\nand temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious and\\nsullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision\\n(when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to\\nthat species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty,\\nunhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden,\\nself-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may\\nbe observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of\\nopium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\\n\\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his\\nearnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to\\nafford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceived\\nto be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, a\\nconstitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired\\nto find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added,\\nwhich would undoubtedly soon pass off.  It displayed itself in a\\nhost of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailed\\nthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms,\\nand the general manner of the narration had their weight.  He\\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most\\ninsipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of\\ncertain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his\\neyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but\\npeculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did\\nnot inspire him with horror.\\n  \")]):_vm._e(),(_vm.author == 'Henry James')?_c('div',{staticClass:\"hide-me\",attrs:{\"id\":\"text-HenryJames\"}},[_vm._v(\"\\n  It had occurred to her early that in her position--that of a young person\\n  spending, in framed and wired confinement, the life of a guinea-pig or a\\n  magpie--she should know a great many persons without their recognising\\n  the acquaintance.  That made it an emotion the more lively--though\\n  singularly rare and always, even then, with opportunity still very much\\n  smothered--to see any one come in whom she knew outside, as she called\\n  it, any one who could add anything to the meanness of her function.  Her\\n  function was to sit there with two young men--the other telegraphist and\\n  the counter-clerk; to mind the \\\"sounder,\\\" which was always going, to dole\\n  out stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters, answer stupid questions,\\n  give difficult change and, more than anything else, count words as\\n  numberless as the sands of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust,\\n  from morning to night, through the gap left in the high lattice, across\\n  the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing.

Late in the afternoon his canary bird, in its\\n  gilt cage just over his head, began to sing. He woke slowly, finished\\n  the rest of his beer--very flat and stale by this time--and taking down\\n  his concertina from the bookcase, where in week days it kept the company\\n  of seven volumes of “Allen's Practical Dentist,” played upon it some\\n  half-dozen very mournful airs.\\n\\n  McTeague looked forward to these Sunday afternoons as a period of\\n  relaxation and enjoyment. He invariably spent them in the same fashion.\\n  These were his only pleasures--to eat, to smoke, to sleep, and to play\\n  upon his concertina.\\n\\n  The six lugubrious airs that he knew, always carried him back to the\\n  time when he was a car-boy at the Big Dipper Mine in Placer County, ten\\n  years before. He remembered the years he had spent there trundling the\\n  heavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction of his\\n  father. For thirteen days of each fortnight his father was a steady,\\n  hard-working shift-boss of the mine. Every other Sunday he became an\\n  irresponsible animal, a beast, a brute, crazy with alcohol.\\n\\n  McTeague remembered his mother, too, who, with the help of the Chinaman,\\n  cooked for forty miners. She was an overworked drudge, fiery and\\n  energetic for all that, filled with the one idea of having her son rise\\n  in life and enter a profession. The chance had come at last when the\\n  father died, corroded with alcohol, collapsing in a few hours. Two or\\n  three years later a travelling dentist visited the mine and put up his\\n  tent near the bunk-house. He was more or less of a charlatan, but he\\n  fired Mrs. McTeague's ambition, and young McTeague went away with him\\n  to learn his profession. He had learnt it after a fashion, mostly by\\n  watching the charlatan operate. He had read many of the necessary books,\\n  but he was too hopelessly stupid to get much benefit from them.\\n\\n  Then one day at San Francisco had come the news of his mother's death;\\n  she had left him some money--not much, but enough to set him up in\\n  business; so he had cut loose from the charlatan and had opened his\\n  “Dental Parlors” on Polk Street, an “accommodation street” of small\\n  shops in the residence quarter of the town. Here he had slowly\\n  collected a clientele of butcher boys, shop girls, drug clerks, and car\\n  conductors. He made but few acquaintances. Polk Street called him the\\n  “Doctor” and spoke of his enormous strength. For McTeague was a young\\n  giant, carrying his huge shock of blond hair six feet three inches\\n  from the ground; moving his immense limbs, heavy with ropes of muscle,\\n  slowly, ponderously. His hands were enormous, red, and covered with a\\n  fell of stiff yellow hair; they were hard as wooden mallets, strong\\n  as vises, the hands of the old-time car-boy. Often he dispensed with\\n  forceps and extracted a refractory tooth with his thumb and finger.\\n  His head was square-cut, angular; the jaw salient, like that of the\\n  carnivora.\\n\\n  McTeague's mind was as his body, heavy, slow to act, sluggish. Yet there\\n  was nothing vicious about the man. Altogether he suggested the draught\\n  horse, immensely strong, stupid, docile, obedient.\\n\\n  When he opened his “Dental Parlors,” he felt that his life was a\\n  success, that he could hope for nothing better. In spite of the name,\\n  there was but one room. It was a corner room on the second floor over\\n  the branch post-office, and faced the street. McTeague made it do for\\n  a bedroom as well, sleeping on the big bed-lounge against the wall\\n  opposite the window. There was a washstand behind the screen in the\\n  corner where he manufactured his moulds. In the round bay window were\\n  his operating chair, his dental engine, and the movable rack on which\\n  he laid out his instruments. Three chairs, a bargain at the second-hand\\n  store, ranged themselves against the wall with military precision\\n  underneath a steel engraving of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, which\\n  he had bought because there were a great many figures in it for the\\n  money. Over the bed-lounge hung a rifle manufacturer's advertisement\\n  calendar which he never used. The other ornaments were a small\\n  marble-topped centre table covered with back numbers of “The American\\n  System of Dentistry,” a stone pug dog sitting before the little stove,\\n  and a thermometer. A stand of shelves occupied one corner, filled with\\n  the seven volumes of “Allen's Practical Dentist.” On the top shelf\\n  McTeague kept his concertina and a bag of bird seed for the canary. The\\n  whole place exhaled a mingled odor of bedding, creosote, and ether.\\n\\n  But for one thing, McTeague would have been perfectly contented. Just\\n  outside his window was his signboard--a modest affair--that read:\\n  “Doctor McTeague. Dental Parlors. Gas Given”; but that was all. It was\\n  his ambition, his dream, to have projecting from that corner window a\\n  huge gilded tooth, a molar with enormous prongs, something gorgeous and\\n  attractive. He would have it some day, on that he was resolved; but as\\n  yet such a thing was far beyond his means.\\n\\n  When he had finished the last of his beer, McTeague slowly wiped his\\n  lips and huge yellow mustache with the side of his hand. Bull-like, he\\n  heaved himself laboriously up, and, going to the window, stood looking\\n  down into the street.\\n\\n  The street never failed to interest him. It was one of those cross\\n  streets peculiar to Western cities, situated in the heart of the\\n  residence quarter, but occupied by small tradespeople who lived in the\\n  rooms above their shops. There were corner drug stores with huge jars\\n  of red, yellow, and green liquids in their windows, very brave and gay;\\n  stationers' stores, where illustrated weeklies were tacked upon bulletin\\n  boards; barber shops with cigar stands in their vestibules; sad-looking\\n  plumbers' offices; cheap restaurants, in whose windows one saw piles of\\n  unopened oysters weighted down by cubes of ice, and china pigs and cows\\n  knee deep in layers of white beans. At one end of the street McTeague\\n  could see the huge power-house of the cable line. Immediately opposite\\n  him was a great market; while farther on, over the chimney stacks of the\\n  intervening houses, the glass roof of some huge public baths glittered\\n  like crystal in the afternoon sun. Underneath him the branch post-office\\n  was opening its doors, as was its custom between two and three\\n  o'clock on Sunday afternoons. An acrid odor of ink rose upward to him.\\n  Occasionally a cable car passed, trundling heavily, with a strident\\n  whirring of jostled glass windows.\\n\\n  On week days the street was very lively. It woke to its work about seven\\n  o'clock, at the time when the newsboys made their appearance together\\n  with the day laborers. The laborers went trudging past in a straggling\\n  file--plumbers' apprentices, their pockets stuffed with sections of\\n  lead pipe, tweezers, and pliers; carpenters, carrying nothing but their\\n  little pasteboard lunch baskets painted to imitate leather; gangs of\\n  street workers, their overalls soiled with yellow clay, their picks and\\n  long-handled shovels over their shoulders; plasterers, spotted with lime\\n  from head to foot. This little army of workers, tramping steadily in\\n  one direction, met and mingled with other toilers of a different\\n  description--conductors and “swing men” of the cable company going on\\n  duty; heavy-eyed night clerks from the drug stores on their way home to\\n  sleep; roundsmen returning to the precinct police station to make their\\n  night report, and Chinese market gardeners teetering past under their\\n  heavy baskets. The cable cars began to fill up; all along the street\\n  could be seen the shopkeepers taking down their shutters.\\n\\n  Between seven and eight the street breakfasted. Now and then a waiter\\n  from one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to the\\n  other, balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin. Everywhere\\n  was the smell of coffee and of frying steaks. A little later, following\\n  in the path of the day laborers, came the clerks and shop girls,\\n  dressed with a certain cheap smartness, always in a hurry, glancing\\n  apprehensively at the power-house clock. Their employers followed\\n  an hour or so later--on the cable cars for the most part whiskered\\n  gentlemen with huge stomachs, reading the morning papers with great\\n  gravity; bank cashiers and insurance clerks with flowers in their\\n  buttonholes.\\n\\n  At the same time the school children invaded the street, filling the air\\n  with a clamor of shrill voices, stopping at the stationers' shops, or\\n  idling a moment in the doorways of the candy stores. For over half an\\n  hour they held possession of the sidewalks, then suddenly disappeared,\\n  leaving behind one or two stragglers who hurried along with great\\n  strides of their little thin legs, very anxious and preoccupied.\\n\\n  Towards eleven o'clock the ladies from the great avenue a block above\\n  Polk Street made their appearance, promenading the sidewalks leisurely,\\n  deliberately. They were at their morning's marketing. They were handsome\\n  women, beautifully dressed. They knew by name their butchers and grocers\\n  and vegetable men. From his window McTeague saw them in front of the\\n  stalls, gloved and veiled and daintily shod, the subservient provision\\n  men at their elbows, scribbling hastily in the order books. They all\\n  seemed to know one another, these grand ladies from the fashionable\\n  avenue. Meetings took place here and there; a conversation was begun;\\n  others arrived; groups were formed; little impromptu receptions were\\n  held before the chopping blocks of butchers' stalls, or on the sidewalk,\\n  around boxes of berries and fruit.\\n\\n  From noon to evening the population of the street was of a mixed\\n  character. The street was busiest at that time; a vast and prolonged\\n  murmur arose--the mingled shuffling of feet, the rattle of wheels, the\\n  heavy trundling of cable cars. At four o'clock the school children\\n  once more swarmed the sidewalks, again disappearing with surprising\\n  suddenness. At six the great homeward march commenced; the cars were\\n  crowded, the laborers thronged the sidewalks, the newsboys chanted the\\n  evening papers. Then all at once the street fell quiet; hardly a soul\\n  was in sight; the sidewalks were deserted. It was supper hour. Evening\\n  began; and one by one a multitude of lights, from the demoniac glare of\\n  the druggists' windows to the dazzling blue whiteness of the electric\\n  globes, grew thick from street corner to street corner. Once more the\\n  street was crowded. Now there was no thought but for amusement. The\\n  cable cars were loaded with theatre-goers--men in high hats and\\n  young girls in furred opera cloaks. On the sidewalks were groups and\\n  couples--the plumbers' apprentices, the girls of the ribbon counters,\\n  the little families that lived on the second stories over their shops,\\n  the dressmakers, the small doctors, the harness-makers--all the various\\n  inhabitants of the street were abroad, strolling idly from shop window\\n  to shop window, taking the air after the day's work. Groups of girls\\n  collected on the corners, talking and laughing very loud, making remarks\\n  upon the young men that passed them. The tamale men appeared. A band of\\n  Salvationists began to sing before a saloon.\\n\\n  Then, little by little, Polk Street dropped back to solitude. Eleven\\n  o'clock struck from the power-house clock. Lights were extinguished. At\\n  one o'clock the cable stopped, leaving an abrupt silence in the air.\\n  All at once it seemed very still. The ugly noises were the occasional\\n  footfalls of a policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese\\n  in the closed market. The street was asleep.\\n\\n  Day after day, McTeague saw the same panorama unroll itself. The bay\\n  window of his “Dental Parlors” was for him a point of vantage from which\\n  he watched the world go past.\\n\\n  On Sundays, however, all was changed. As he stood in the bay window,\\n  after finishing his beer, wiping his lips, and looking out into the\\n  street, McTeague was conscious of the difference. Nearly all the stores\\n  were closed. No wagons passed. A few people hurried up and down the\\n  sidewalks, dressed in cheap Sunday finery. A cable car went by; on the\\n  outside seats were a party of returning picnickers. The mother, the\\n  father, a young man, and a young girl, and three children. The two older\\n  people held empty lunch baskets in their laps, while the bands of the\\n  children's hats were stuck full of oak leaves. The girl carried a huge\\n  bunch of wilting poppies and wild flowers.\\n\\n  As the car approached McTeague's window the young man got up and swung\\n  himself off the platform, waving goodby to the party. Suddenly McTeague\\n  recognized him.\\n\\n  “There's Marcus Schouler,” he muttered behind his mustache.\\n\\n  Marcus Schouler was the dentist's one intimate friend. The acquaintance\\n  had begun at the car conductors' coffee-joint, where the two occupied\\n  the same table and met at every meal. Then they made the discovery that\\n  they both lived in the same flat, Marcus occupying a room on the floor\\n  above McTeague. On different occasions McTeague had treated Marcus for\\n  an ulcerated tooth and had refused to accept payment. Soon it came to be\\n  an understood thing between them. They were “pals.”\\n\\n  McTeague, listening, heard Marcus go up-stairs to his room above. In a\\n  few minutes his door opened again. McTeague knew that he had come out\\n  into the hall and was leaning over the banisters.\\n\\n  “Oh, Mac!” he called. McTeague came to his door.\\n\\n  “Hullo! 'sthat you, Mark?”\\n\\n  “Sure,” answered Marcus. “Come on up.”\\n\\n  “You come on down.”\\n\\n  “No, come on up.”\\n\\n  “Oh, you come on down.”\\n\\n  “Oh, you lazy duck!” retorted Marcus, coming down the stairs.\\n\\n  “Been out to the Cliff House on a picnic,” he explained as he sat down\\n  on the bed-lounge, “with my uncle and his people--the Sieppes, you know.\\n  By damn! it was hot,” he suddenly vociferated. “Just look at that! Just\\n  look at that!” he cried, dragging at his limp collar. “That's the third\\n  one since morning; it is--it is, for a fact--and you got your stove\\n  going.” He began to tell about the picnic, talking very loud and fast,\\n  gesturing furiously, very excited over trivial details. Marcus could not\\n  talk without getting excited.\\n\\n  “You ought t'have seen, y'ought t'have seen. I tell you, it was outa\\n  sight. It was; it was, for a fact.”\\n\\n  “Yes, yes,” answered McTeague, bewildered, trying to follow. “Yes,\\n  that's so.”\\n\\n  In recounting a certain dispute with an awkward bicyclist, in which it\\n  appeared he had become involved, Marcus quivered with rage. “'Say that\\n  again,' says I to um. 'Just say that once more, and'”--here a rolling\\n  explosion of oaths--“'you'll go back to the city in the Morgue wagon.\\n  Ain't I got a right to cross a street even, I'd like to know, without\\n  being run down--what?' I say it's outrageous. I'd a knifed him in\\n  another minute. It was an outrage. I say it was an outrage.”\\n\\n  “Sure it was,” McTeague hastened to reply. “Sure, sure.”\\n\\n  “Oh, and we had an accident,” shouted the other, suddenly off on another\\n  tack. “It was awful. Trina was in the swing there--that's my cousin\\n  Trina, you know who I mean--and she fell out. By damn! I thought she'd\\n  killed herself; struck her face on a rock and knocked out a front tooth.\\n  It's a wonder she didn't kill herself. It IS a wonder; it is, for a\\n  fact. Ain't it, now? Huh? Ain't it? Y'ought t'have seen.”\\n\\n  McTeague had a vague idea that Marcus Schouler was stuck on his cousin\\n  Trina. They “kept company” a good deal; Marcus took dinner with the\\n  Sieppes every Saturday evening at their home at B Street station, across\\n  the bay, and Sunday afternoons he and the family usually made little\\n  excursions into the suburbs. McTeague began to wonder dimly how it\\n  was that on this occasion Marcus had not gone home with his cousin. As\\n  sometimes happens, Marcus furnished the explanation upon the instant.\\n\\n  “I promised a duck up here on the avenue I'd call for his dog at four\\n  this afternoon.”\\n\\n  Marcus was Old Grannis's assistant in a little dog hospital that the\\n  latter had opened in a sort of alley just off Polk Street, some four\\n  blocks above Old Grannis lived in one of the back rooms of McTeague's\\n  flat. He was an Englishman and an expert dog surgeon, but Marcus\\n  Schouler was a bungler in the profession. His father had been a\\n  veterinary surgeon who had kept a livery stable near by, on California\\n  Street, and Marcus's knowledge of the diseases of domestic animals had\\n  been picked up in a haphazard way, much after the manner of McTeague's\\n  education. Somehow he managed to impress Old Grannis, a gentle,\\n  simple-minded old man, with a sense of his fitness, bewildering him with\\n  a torrent of empty phrases that he delivered with fierce gestures and\\n  with a manner of the greatest conviction.\\n\\n  “You'd better come along with me, Mac,” observed Marcus. “We'll get the\\n  duck's dog, and then we'll take a little walk, huh? You got nothun to\\n  do. Come along.”\\n\\n  McTeague went out with him, and the two friends proceeded up to the\\n  avenue to the house where the dog was to be found. It was a huge\\n  mansion-like place, set in an enormous garden that occupied a whole\\n  third of the block; and while Marcus tramped up the front steps and rang\\n  the doorbell boldly, to show his independence, McTeague remained below\\n  on the sidewalk, gazing stupidly at the curtained windows, the marble\\n  steps, and the bronze griffins, troubled and a little confused by all\\n  this massive luxury.\\n\\n  After they had taken the dog to the hospital and had left him to whimper\\n  behind the wire netting, they returned to Polk Street and had a glass of\\n  beer in the back room of Joe Frenna's corner grocery.\\n\\n  Ever since they had left the huge mansion on the avenue, Marcus had been\\n  attacking the capitalists, a class which he pretended to execrate. It\\n  was a pose which he often assumed, certain of impressing the dentist.\\n  Marcus had picked up a few half-truths of political economy--it was\\n  impossible to say where--and as soon as the two had settled themselves\\n  to their beer in Frenna's back room he took up the theme of the labor\\n  question. He discussed it at the top of his voice, vociferating, shaking\\n  his fists, exciting himself with his own noise. He was continually\\n  making use of the stock phrases of the professional politician--phrases\\n  he had caught at some of the ward “rallies” and “ratification meetings.”\\n   These rolled off his tongue with incredible emphasis, appearing at every\\n  turn of his conversation--“Outraged constituencies,” “cause of labor,”\\n   “wage earners,” “opinions biased by personal interests,” “eyes blinded\\n  by party prejudice.” McTeague listened to him, awestruck.\\n\\n  “There's where the evil lies,” Marcus would cry. “The masses must learn\\n  self-control; it stands to reason. Look at the figures, look at the\\n  figures. Decrease the number of wage earners and you increase wages,\\n  don't you? don't you?”\\n\\n  Absolutely stupid, and understanding never a word, McTeague would\\n  answer:\\n\\n  “Yes, yes, that's it--self-control--that's the word.”\\n\\n  “It's the capitalists that's ruining the cause of labor,” shouted\\n  Marcus, banging the table with his fist till the beer glasses danced;\\n  “white-livered drones, traitors, with their livers white as snow, eatun\\n  the bread of widows and orphuns; there's where the evil lies.”\\n\\n  Stupefied with his clamor, McTeague answered, wagging his head:\\n\\n  “Yes, that's it; I think it's their livers.”\\n\\n  Suddenly Marcus fell calm again, forgetting his pose all in an instant.\\n\\n  “Say, Mac, I told my cousin Trina to come round and see you about that\\n  tooth of hers. She'll be in to-morrow, I guess.”\\n  \")]):_vm._e(),(_vm.author == 'Gertrude Stein')?_c('div',{staticClass:\"hide-me\",attrs:{\"id\":\"text-GertrudeStein\"}},[_vm._v(\"\\n    In the inside there is sleeping, in the outside there is reddening, in\\nthe morning there is meaning, in the evening there is feeling.

I know not how it was--but, with the\nfirst glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloom\npervaded my spirit.  I say insufferable; for the feeling was\nunrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic,\nsentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\nnatural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon the\nscene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape\nfeatures of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant\neye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few white\ntrunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which I\ncan compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the\nafter-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse into\neveryday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There was\nan iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed\ndreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could\ntorture into aught of the sublime.  What was it--I paused to\nthink--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of\nthe House of Usher?  It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could I\ngrapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I\npondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory\nconclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations\nof very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\naffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among\nconsiderations beyond our depth.  It was possible, I reflected,\nthat a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the\nscene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to\nmodify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful\nimpression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horse\nto the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in\nunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a\nshudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and\ninverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems,\nand the vacant and eye-like windows.\n\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to\nmyself a sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,\nhad been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had\nelapsed since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had lately\nreached me in a distant part of the country--a letter from\nhim--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no\nother than a personal reply.  The MS gave evidence of nervous\nagitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental\ndisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me,\nas his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of\nattempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation\nof his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and much\nmore, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with his\nrequest--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I\naccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very\nsingular summons.\n\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet\nI really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been always\nexcessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his very\nancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar\nsensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,\nin many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in\nrepeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as\nin a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more\nthan to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical\nscience.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\nstem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put\nforth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that\nthe entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had\nalways, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.\nIt was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in\nthought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with\nthe accredited character of the people, and while speculating\nupon the possible influence which the one, in the long\nlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was\nthis deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent\nundeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with\nthe name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge\nthe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal\nappellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemed\nto include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the\nfamily and the family mansion.\n\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\nexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to\ndeepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that\nthe consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--for\nwhy should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the\nincrease itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law\nof all sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might have\nbeen for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to\nthe house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in my\nmind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but\nmention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which\noppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really to\nbelieve that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an\natmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--an\natmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, but\nwhich had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall,\nand the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull,\nsluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\n\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream,\nI scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its\nprincipal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.\nThe discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi\noverspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work\nfrom the eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary\ndilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there\nappeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\nadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the\nindividual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me of\nthe specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long\nyears in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from the\nbreath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication of\nextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of\ninstability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might\nhave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending\nfrom the roof of the building in front, made its way down the\nwall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen\nwaters of the tarn.\n\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the\nhouse.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the\nGothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence\nconducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate\npassages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Much\nthat I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to\nheighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.\nWhile the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,\nthe sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of the\nfloors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as\nI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I had\nbeen accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not to\nacknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to find\nhow unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were\nstirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician of\nthe family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled\nexpression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with\ntrepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and\nushered me into the presence of his master.\n\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.\nThe windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a\ndistance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible\nfrom within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way\nthrough the trellised panes, and served to render sufficiently\ndistinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,\nstruggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or\nthe recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies\nhung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse,\ncomfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical\ninstruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality\nto the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.\nAn air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and\npervaded all.\n\nUpon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he had\nbeen lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth\nwhich had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone\ncordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of\nthe world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me\nof his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments,\nwhile he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity,\nhalf of awe.  Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,\nin so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was with\ndifficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the\nman being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.  Yet\nthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  A\ncadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous\nbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a\nsurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,\nbut with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a\nfinely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a\nwant of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\ntenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the\nregions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not\neasily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the\nprevailing character of these features, and of the expression\nthey were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to\nwhom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now\nmiraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even\nawed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all\nunheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather\nthan fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\nits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an\nincoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise\nfrom a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an\nhabitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  For\nsomething of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by\nhis letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and\nby conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation\nand temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious and\nsullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision\n(when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to\nthat species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty,\nunhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden,\nself-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which may\nbe observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of\nopium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.\n\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his\nearnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to\nafford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceived\nto be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, a\nconstitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired\nto find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added,\nwhich would undoubtedly soon pass off.  It displayed itself in a\nhost of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailed\nthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms,\nand the general manner of the narration had their weight.  He\nsuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most\ninsipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments of\ncertain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; his\neyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were but\npeculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which did\nnot inspire him with horror.\n  </div>\n\n  <div v-if=\"author == 'Henry James'\" id='text-HenryJames' class='hide-me'>\n  It had occurred to her early that in her position--that of a young person\n  spending, in framed and wired confinement, the life of a guinea-pig or a\n  magpie--she should know a great many persons without their recognising\n  the acquaintance.  That made it an emotion the more lively--though\n  singularly rare and always, even then, with opportunity still very much\n  smothered--to see any one come in whom she knew outside, as she called\n  it, any one who could add anything to the meanness of her function.  Her\n  function was to sit there with two young men--the other telegraphist and\n  the counter-clerk; to mind the \"sounder,\" which was always going, to dole\n  out stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters, answer stupid questions,\n  give difficult change and, more than anything else, count words as\n  numberless as the sands of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust,\n  from morning to night, through the gap left in the high lattice, across\n  the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing.  This\n  transparent screen fenced out or fenced in, according to the side of the\n  narrow counter on which the human lot was cast, the duskiest corner of a\n  shop pervaded not a little, in winter, by the poison of perpetual gas,\n  and at all times by the presence of hams, cheese, dried fish, soap,\n  varnish, paraffin and other solids and fluids that she came to know\n  perfectly by their smells without consenting to know them by their names.\n\n  The barrier that divided the little post-and-telegraph-office from the\n  grocery was a frail structure of wood and wire; but the social, the\n  professional separation was a gulf that fortune, by a stroke quite\n  remarkable, had spared her the necessity of contributing at all publicly\n  to bridge.  When Mr. Cocker's young men stepped over from behind the\n  other counter to change a five-pound note--and Mr. Cocker's situation,\n  with the cream of the \"Court Guide\" and the dearest furnished apartments,\n  Simpkin's, Ladle's, Thrupp's, just round the corner, was so select that\n  his place was quite pervaded by the crisp rustle of these emblems--she\n  pushed out the sovereigns as if the applicant were no more to her than\n  one of the momentary, the practically featureless, appearances in the\n  great procession; and this perhaps all the more from the very fact of the\n  connexion (only recognised outside indeed) to which she had lent herself\n  with ridiculous inconsequence.  She recognised the others the less\n  because she had at last so unreservedly, so irredeemably, recognised Mr.\n  Mudge.  However that might be, she was a little ashamed of having to\n  admit to herself that Mr. Mudge's removal to a higher sphere--to a more\n  commanding position, that is, though to a much lower neighbourhood--would\n  have been described still better as a luxury than as the mere\n  simplification, the corrected awkwardness, that she contented herself\n  with calling it.  He had at any rate ceased to be all day long in her\n  eyes, and this left something a little fresh for them to rest on of a\n  Sunday.  During the three months of his happy survival at Cocker's after\n  her consent to their engagement she had often asked herself what it was\n  marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that seemed already to\n  have scraped the platter so clean.  Opposite there, behind the counter of\n  which his superior stature, his whiter apron, his more clustering curls\n  and more present, too present, _h_'s had been for a couple of years the\n  principal ornament, he had moved to and fro before her as on the small\n  sanded floor of their contracted future.  She was conscious now of the\n  improvement of not having to take her present and her future at once.\n  They were about as much as she could manage when taken separate.\n\n  She had, none the less, to give her mind steadily to what Mr. Mudge had\n  again written her about, the idea of her applying for a transfer to an\n  office quite similar--she couldn't yet hope for a place in a bigger--under\n  the very roof where he was foreman, so that, dangled before her every\n  minute of the day, he should see her, as he called it, \"hourly,\" and in a\n  part, the far N.W. district, where, with her mother, she would save on\n  their two rooms alone nearly three shillings.  It would be far from\n  dazzling to exchange Mayfair for Chalk Farm, and it wore upon her much\n  that he could never drop a subject; still, it didn't wear as things _had_\n  worn, the worries of the early times of their great misery, her own, her\n  mother's and her elder sister's--the last of whom had succumbed to all\n  but absolute want when, as conscious and incredulous ladies, suddenly\n  bereft, betrayed, overwhelmed, they had slipped faster and faster down\n  the steep slope at the bottom of which she alone had rebounded.  Her\n  mother had never rebounded any more at the bottom than on the way; had\n  only rumbled and grumbled down and down, making, in respect of caps,\n  topics and \"habits,\" no effort whatever--which simply meant smelling much\n  of the time of whiskey.\n  </div>\n\n  <div v-if=\"author == 'Frank Norris'\" id='text-FrankNorris' class='hide-me'>\n  It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that day, McTeague took\n  his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car conductors' coffee-joint\n  on Polk Street. He had a thick gray soup; heavy, underdone meat, very\n  hot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet\n  pudding, full of strong butter and sugar. On his way back to his office,\n  one block above, he stopped at Joe Frenna's saloon and bought a pitcher\n  of steam beer. It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to\n  dinner.\n\n  Once in his office, or, as he called it on his signboard, “Dental\n  Parlors,” he took off his coat and shoes, unbuttoned his vest, and,\n  having crammed his little stove full of coke, lay back in his operating\n  chair at the bay window, reading the paper, drinking his beer, and\n  smoking his huge porcelain pipe while his food digested; crop-full,\n  stupid, and warm. By and by, gorged with steam beer, and overcome by the\n  heat of the room, the cheap tobacco, and the effects of his heavy meal,\n  he dropped off to sleep. Late in the afternoon his canary bird, in its\n  gilt cage just over his head, began to sing. He woke slowly, finished\n  the rest of his beer--very flat and stale by this time--and taking down\n  his concertina from the bookcase, where in week days it kept the company\n  of seven volumes of “Allen's Practical Dentist,” played upon it some\n  half-dozen very mournful airs.\n\n  McTeague looked forward to these Sunday afternoons as a period of\n  relaxation and enjoyment. He invariably spent them in the same fashion.\n  These were his only pleasures--to eat, to smoke, to sleep, and to play\n  upon his concertina.\n\n  The six lugubrious airs that he knew, always carried him back to the\n  time when he was a car-boy at the Big Dipper Mine in Placer County, ten\n  years before. He remembered the years he had spent there trundling the\n  heavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction of his\n  father. For thirteen days of each fortnight his father was a steady,\n  hard-working shift-boss of the mine. Every other Sunday he became an\n  irresponsible animal, a beast, a brute, crazy with alcohol.\n\n  McTeague remembered his mother, too, who, with the help of the Chinaman,\n  cooked for forty miners. She was an overworked drudge, fiery and\n  energetic for all that, filled with the one idea of having her son rise\n  in life and enter a profession. The chance had come at last when the\n  father died, corroded with alcohol, collapsing in a few hours. Two or\n  three years later a travelling dentist visited the mine and put up his\n  tent near the bunk-house. He was more or less of a charlatan, but he\n  fired Mrs. McTeague's ambition, and young McTeague went away with him\n  to learn his profession. He had learnt it after a fashion, mostly by\n  watching the charlatan operate. He had read many of the necessary books,\n  but he was too hopelessly stupid to get much benefit from them.\n\n  Then one day at San Francisco had come the news of his mother's death;\n  she had left him some money--not much, but enough to set him up in\n  business; so he had cut loose from the charlatan and had opened his\n  “Dental Parlors” on Polk Street, an “accommodation street” of small\n  shops in the residence quarter of the town. Here he had slowly\n  collected a clientele of butcher boys, shop girls, drug clerks, and car\n  conductors. He made but few acquaintances. Polk Street called him the\n  “Doctor” and spoke of his enormous strength. For McTeague was a young\n  giant, carrying his huge shock of blond hair six feet three inches\n  from the ground; moving his immense limbs, heavy with ropes of muscle,\n  slowly, ponderously. His hands were enormous, red, and covered with a\n  fell of stiff yellow hair; they were hard as wooden mallets, strong\n  as vises, the hands of the old-time car-boy. Often he dispensed with\n  forceps and extracted a refractory tooth with his thumb and finger.\n  His head was square-cut, angular; the jaw salient, like that of the\n  carnivora.\n\n  McTeague's mind was as his body, heavy, slow to act, sluggish. Yet there\n  was nothing vicious about the man. Altogether he suggested the draught\n  horse, immensely strong, stupid, docile, obedient.\n\n  When he opened his “Dental Parlors,” he felt that his life was a\n  success, that he could hope for nothing better. In spite of the name,\n  there was but one room. It was a corner room on the second floor over\n  the branch post-office, and faced the street. McTeague made it do for\n  a bedroom as well, sleeping on the big bed-lounge against the wall\n  opposite the window. There was a washstand behind the screen in the\n  corner where he manufactured his moulds. In the round bay window were\n  his operating chair, his dental engine, and the movable rack on which\n  he laid out his instruments. Three chairs, a bargain at the second-hand\n  store, ranged themselves against the wall with military precision\n  underneath a steel engraving of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, which\n  he had bought because there were a great many figures in it for the\n  money. Over the bed-lounge hung a rifle manufacturer's advertisement\n  calendar which he never used. The other ornaments were a small\n  marble-topped centre table covered with back numbers of “The American\n  System of Dentistry,” a stone pug dog sitting before the little stove,\n  and a thermometer. A stand of shelves occupied one corner, filled with\n  the seven volumes of “Allen's Practical Dentist.” On the top shelf\n  McTeague kept his concertina and a bag of bird seed for the canary. The\n  whole place exhaled a mingled odor of bedding, creosote, and ether.\n\n  But for one thing, McTeague would have been perfectly contented. Just\n  outside his window was his signboard--a modest affair--that read:\n  “Doctor McTeague. Dental Parlors. Gas Given”; but that was all. It was\n  his ambition, his dream, to have projecting from that corner window a\n  huge gilded tooth, a molar with enormous prongs, something gorgeous and\n  attractive. He would have it some day, on that he was resolved; but as\n  yet such a thing was far beyond his means.\n\n  When he had finished the last of his beer, McTeague slowly wiped his\n  lips and huge yellow mustache with the side of his hand. Bull-like, he\n  heaved himself laboriously up, and, going to the window, stood looking\n  down into the street.\n\n  The street never failed to interest him. It was one of those cross\n  streets peculiar to Western cities, situated in the heart of the\n  residence quarter, but occupied by small tradespeople who lived in the\n  rooms above their shops. There were corner drug stores with huge jars\n  of red, yellow, and green liquids in their windows, very brave and gay;\n  stationers' stores, where illustrated weeklies were tacked upon bulletin\n  boards; barber shops with cigar stands in their vestibules; sad-looking\n  plumbers' offices; cheap restaurants, in whose windows one saw piles of\n  unopened oysters weighted down by cubes of ice, and china pigs and cows\n  knee deep in layers of white beans. At one end of the street McTeague\n  could see the huge power-house of the cable line. Immediately opposite\n  him was a great market; while farther on, over the chimney stacks of the\n  intervening houses, the glass roof of some huge public baths glittered\n  like crystal in the afternoon sun. Underneath him the branch post-office\n  was opening its doors, as was its custom between two and three\n  o'clock on Sunday afternoons. An acrid odor of ink rose upward to him.\n  Occasionally a cable car passed, trundling heavily, with a strident\n  whirring of jostled glass windows.\n\n  On week days the street was very lively. It woke to its work about seven\n  o'clock, at the time when the newsboys made their appearance together\n  with the day laborers. The laborers went trudging past in a straggling\n  file--plumbers' apprentices, their pockets stuffed with sections of\n  lead pipe, tweezers, and pliers; carpenters, carrying nothing but their\n  little pasteboard lunch baskets painted to imitate leather; gangs of\n  street workers, their overalls soiled with yellow clay, their picks and\n  long-handled shovels over their shoulders; plasterers, spotted with lime\n  from head to foot. This little army of workers, tramping steadily in\n  one direction, met and mingled with other toilers of a different\n  description--conductors and “swing men” of the cable company going on\n  duty; heavy-eyed night clerks from the drug stores on their way home to\n  sleep; roundsmen returning to the precinct police station to make their\n  night report, and Chinese market gardeners teetering past under their\n  heavy baskets. The cable cars began to fill up; all along the street\n  could be seen the shopkeepers taking down their shutters.\n\n  Between seven and eight the street breakfasted. Now and then a waiter\n  from one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to the\n  other, balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin. Everywhere\n  was the smell of coffee and of frying steaks. A little later, following\n  in the path of the day laborers, came the clerks and shop girls,\n  dressed with a certain cheap smartness, always in a hurry, glancing\n  apprehensively at the power-house clock. Their employers followed\n  an hour or so later--on the cable cars for the most part whiskered\n  gentlemen with huge stomachs, reading the morning papers with great\n  gravity; bank cashiers and insurance clerks with flowers in their\n  buttonholes.\n\n  At the same time the school children invaded the street, filling the air\n  with a clamor of shrill voices, stopping at the stationers' shops, or\n  idling a moment in the doorways of the candy stores. For over half an\n  hour they held possession of the sidewalks, then suddenly disappeared,\n  leaving behind one or two stragglers who hurried along with great\n  strides of their little thin legs, very anxious and preoccupied.\n\n  Towards eleven o'clock the ladies from the great avenue a block above\n  Polk Street made their appearance, promenading the sidewalks leisurely,\n  deliberately. They were at their morning's marketing. They were handsome\n  women, beautifully dressed. They knew by name their butchers and grocers\n  and vegetable men. From his window McTeague saw them in front of the\n  stalls, gloved and veiled and daintily shod, the subservient provision\n  men at their elbows, scribbling hastily in the order books. They all\n  seemed to know one another, these grand ladies from the fashionable\n  avenue. Meetings took place here and there; a conversation was begun;\n  others arrived; groups were formed; little impromptu receptions were\n  held before the chopping blocks of butchers' stalls, or on the sidewalk,\n  around boxes of berries and fruit.\n\n  From noon to evening the population of the street was of a mixed\n  character. The street was busiest at that time; a vast and prolonged\n  murmur arose--the mingled shuffling of feet, the rattle of wheels, the\n  heavy trundling of cable cars. At four o'clock the school children\n  once more swarmed the sidewalks, again disappearing with surprising\n  suddenness. At six the great homeward march commenced; the cars were\n  crowded, the laborers thronged the sidewalks, the newsboys chanted the\n  evening papers. Then all at once the street fell quiet; hardly a soul\n  was in sight; the sidewalks were deserted. It was supper hour. Evening\n  began; and one by one a multitude of lights, from the demoniac glare of\n  the druggists' windows to the dazzling blue whiteness of the electric\n  globes, grew thick from street corner to street corner. Once more the\n  street was crowded. Now there was no thought but for amusement. The\n  cable cars were loaded with theatre-goers--men in high hats and\n  young girls in furred opera cloaks. On the sidewalks were groups and\n  couples--the plumbers' apprentices, the girls of the ribbon counters,\n  the little families that lived on the second stories over their shops,\n  the dressmakers, the small doctors, the harness-makers--all the various\n  inhabitants of the street were abroad, strolling idly from shop window\n  to shop window, taking the air after the day's work. Groups of girls\n  collected on the corners, talking and laughing very loud, making remarks\n  upon the young men that passed them. The tamale men appeared. A band of\n  Salvationists began to sing before a saloon.\n\n  Then, little by little, Polk Street dropped back to solitude. Eleven\n  o'clock struck from the power-house clock. Lights were extinguished. At\n  one o'clock the cable stopped, leaving an abrupt silence in the air.\n  All at once it seemed very still. The ugly noises were the occasional\n  footfalls of a policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese\n  in the closed market. The street was asleep.\n\n  Day after day, McTeague saw the same panorama unroll itself. The bay\n  window of his “Dental Parlors” was for him a point of vantage from which\n  he watched the world go past.\n\n  On Sundays, however, all was changed. As he stood in the bay window,\n  after finishing his beer, wiping his lips, and looking out into the\n  street, McTeague was conscious of the difference. Nearly all the stores\n  were closed. No wagons passed. A few people hurried up and down the\n  sidewalks, dressed in cheap Sunday finery. A cable car went by; on the\n  outside seats were a party of returning picnickers. The mother, the\n  father, a young man, and a young girl, and three children. The two older\n  people held empty lunch baskets in their laps, while the bands of the\n  children's hats were stuck full of oak leaves. The girl carried a huge\n  bunch of wilting poppies and wild flowers.\n\n  As the car approached McTeague's window the young man got up and swung\n  himself off the platform, waving goodby to the party. Suddenly McTeague\n  recognized him.\n\n  “There's Marcus Schouler,” he muttered behind his mustache.\n\n  Marcus Schouler was the dentist's one intimate friend. The acquaintance\n  had begun at the car conductors' coffee-joint, where the two occupied\n  the same table and met at every meal. Then they made the discovery that\n  they both lived in the same flat, Marcus occupying a room on the floor\n  above McTeague. On different occasions McTeague had treated Marcus for\n  an ulcerated tooth and had refused to accept payment. Soon it came to be\n  an understood thing between them. They were “pals.”\n\n  McTeague, listening, heard Marcus go up-stairs to his room above. In a\n  few minutes his door opened again. McTeague knew that he had come out\n  into the hall and was leaning over the banisters.\n\n  “Oh, Mac!” he called. McTeague came to his door.\n\n  “Hullo! 'sthat you, Mark?”\n\n  “Sure,” answered Marcus. “Come on up.”\n\n  “You come on down.”\n\n  “No, come on up.”\n\n  “Oh, you come on down.”\n\n  “Oh, you lazy duck!” retorted Marcus, coming down the stairs.\n\n  “Been out to the Cliff House on a picnic,” he explained as he sat down\n  on the bed-lounge, “with my uncle and his people--the Sieppes, you know.\n  By damn! it was hot,” he suddenly vociferated. “Just look at that! Just\n  look at that!” he cried, dragging at his limp collar. “That's the third\n  one since morning; it is--it is, for a fact--and you got your stove\n  going.” He began to tell about the picnic, talking very loud and fast,\n  gesturing furiously, very excited over trivial details. Marcus could not\n  talk without getting excited.\n\n  “You ought t'have seen, y'ought t'have seen. I tell you, it was outa\n  sight. It was; it was, for a fact.”\n\n  “Yes, yes,” answered McTeague, bewildered, trying to follow. “Yes,\n  that's so.”\n\n  In recounting a certain dispute with an awkward bicyclist, in which it\n  appeared he had become involved, Marcus quivered with rage. “'Say that\n  again,' says I to um. 'Just say that once more, and'”--here a rolling\n  explosion of oaths--“'you'll go back to the city in the Morgue wagon.\n  Ain't I got a right to cross a street even, I'd like to know, without\n  being run down--what?' I say it's outrageous. I'd a knifed him in\n  another minute. It was an outrage. I say it was an outrage.”\n\n  “Sure it was,” McTeague hastened to reply. “Sure, sure.”\n\n  “Oh, and we had an accident,” shouted the other, suddenly off on another\n  tack. “It was awful. Trina was in the swing there--that's my cousin\n  Trina, you know who I mean--and she fell out. By damn! I thought she'd\n  killed herself; struck her face on a rock and knocked out a front tooth.\n  It's a wonder she didn't kill herself. It IS a wonder; it is, for a\n  fact. Ain't it, now? Huh? Ain't it? Y'ought t'have seen.”\n\n  McTeague had a vague idea that Marcus Schouler was stuck on his cousin\n  Trina. They “kept company” a good deal; Marcus took dinner with the\n  Sieppes every Saturday evening at their home at B Street station, across\n  the bay, and Sunday afternoons he and the family usually made little\n  excursions into the suburbs. McTeague began to wonder dimly how it\n  was that on this occasion Marcus had not gone home with his cousin. As\n  sometimes happens, Marcus furnished the explanation upon the instant.\n\n  “I promised a duck up here on the avenue I'd call for his dog at four\n  this afternoon.”\n\n  Marcus was Old Grannis's assistant in a little dog hospital that the\n  latter had opened in a sort of alley just off Polk Street, some four\n  blocks above Old Grannis lived in one of the back rooms of McTeague's\n  flat. He was an Englishman and an expert dog surgeon, but Marcus\n  Schouler was a bungler in the profession. His father had been a\n  veterinary surgeon who had kept a livery stable near by, on California\n  Street, and Marcus's knowledge of the diseases of domestic animals had\n  been picked up in a haphazard way, much after the manner of McTeague's\n  education. Somehow he managed to impress Old Grannis, a gentle,\n  simple-minded old man, with a sense of his fitness, bewildering him with\n  a torrent of empty phrases that he delivered with fierce gestures and\n  with a manner of the greatest conviction.\n\n  “You'd better come along with me, Mac,” observed Marcus. “We'll get the\n  duck's dog, and then we'll take a little walk, huh? You got nothun to\n  do. Come along.”\n\n  McTeague went out with him, and the two friends proceeded up to the\n  avenue to the house where the dog was to be found. It was a huge\n  mansion-like place, set in an enormous garden that occupied a whole\n  third of the block; and while Marcus tramped up the front steps and rang\n  the doorbell boldly, to show his independence, McTeague remained below\n  on the sidewalk, gazing stupidly at the curtained windows, the marble\n  steps, and the bronze griffins, troubled and a little confused by all\n  this massive luxury.\n\n  After they had taken the dog to the hospital and had left him to whimper\n  behind the wire netting, they returned to Polk Street and had a glass of\n  beer in the back room of Joe Frenna's corner grocery.\n\n  Ever since they had left the huge mansion on the avenue, Marcus had been\n  attacking the capitalists, a class which he pretended to execrate. It\n  was a pose which he often assumed, certain of impressing the dentist.\n  Marcus had picked up a few half-truths of political economy--it was\n  impossible to say where--and as soon as the two had settled themselves\n  to their beer in Frenna's back room he took up the theme of the labor\n  question. He discussed it at the top of his voice, vociferating, shaking\n  his fists, exciting himself with his own noise. He was continually\n  making use of the stock phrases of the professional politician--phrases\n  he had caught at some of the ward “rallies” and “ratification meetings.”\n   These rolled off his tongue with incredible emphasis, appearing at every\n  turn of his conversation--“Outraged constituencies,” “cause of labor,”\n   “wage earners,” “opinions biased by personal interests,” “eyes blinded\n  by party prejudice.” McTeague listened to him, awestruck.\n\n  “There's where the evil lies,” Marcus would cry. “The masses must learn\n  self-control; it stands to reason. Look at the figures, look at the\n  figures. Decrease the number of wage earners and you increase wages,\n  don't you? don't you?”\n\n  Absolutely stupid, and understanding never a word, McTeague would\n  answer:\n\n  “Yes, yes, that's it--self-control--that's the word.”\n\n  “It's the capitalists that's ruining the cause of labor,” shouted\n  Marcus, banging the table with his fist till the beer glasses danced;\n  “white-livered drones, traitors, with their livers white as snow, eatun\n  the bread of widows and orphuns; there's where the evil lies.”\n\n  Stupefied with his clamor, McTeague answered, wagging his head:\n\n  “Yes, that's it; I think it's their livers.”\n\n  Suddenly Marcus fell calm again, forgetting his pose all in an instant.\n\n  “Say, Mac, I told my cousin Trina to come round and see you about that\n  tooth of hers. She'll be in to-morrow, I guess.”\n  </div>\n\n  <div v-if=\"author == 'Gertrude Stein'\" id='text-GertrudeStein' class='hide-me'>\n    In the inside there is sleeping, in the outside there is reddening, in\nthe morning there is meaning, in the evening there is feeling.

To shine, why not shine, to shine, to station, to\nenlarge, to hurry the measure all this means nothing if there is\nsinging, if there is singing then there is the resumption.\n\nThe change the dirt, not to change dirt means that there is no beefsteak\nand not to have that is no obstruction, it is so easy to exchange\nmeaning, it is so easy to see the difference. The difference is that a\nplain resource is not entangled with thickness and it does not mean that\nthickness shows such cutting, it does mean that a meadow is useful and a\ncow absurd. It does not mean that there are tears, it does not mean that\nexudation is cumbersome, it means no more than a memory, a choice and a\nreëstablishment, it means more than any escape from a surrounding extra.\nAll the time that there is use there is use and any time there is a\nsurface there is a surface, and every time there is an exception there\nis an exception and every time there is a division there is a dividing.\nAny time there is a surface there is a surface and every time there is a\nsuggestion there is a suggestion and every time there is silence there\nis silence and every time that is languid there is that there then and\nnot oftener, not always, not particular, tender and changing and\nexternal and central and surrounded and singular and simple and the same\nand the surface and the circle and the shine and the succor and the\nwhite and the same and the better and the red and the same and the\ncentre and the yellow and the tender and the better, and altogether.\n\nConsidering the circumstances there is no occasion for a reduction,\nconsidering that there is no pealing there is no occasion for an\nobligation, considering that there is no outrage there is no necessity\nfor any reparation, considering that there is no particle sodden there\nis no occasion for deliberation. Considering everything and which way\nthe turn is tending, considering everything why is there no restraint,\nconsidering everything what makes the place settle and the plate\ndistinguish some specialties. The whole thing is not understood and this\nis not strange considering that there is no education, this is not\nstrange because having that certainly does show the difference in\ncutting, it shows that when there is turning there is no distress.\n\nIn kind, in a control, in a period, in the alteration of pigeons, in\nkind cuts and thick and thin spaces, in kind ham and different colors,\nthe length of leaning a strong thing outside not to make a sound but to\nsuggest a crust, the principal taste is when there is a whole chance to\nbe reasonable, this does not mean that there is overtaking, this means\nnothing precious, this means clearly that the chance to exercise is a\nsocial success.

A regulation is not active.\nThirstiness is not equal division.\n\nAnyway, to be older and ageder is not a surfeit nor a suction, it is not\ndated and careful, it is not dirty. Any little thing is clean, rubbing\nis black. Why should ancient lambs be goats and young colts and never\nbeef, why should they, they should because there is so much difference\nin age.\n\nA sound, a whole sound is not separation, a whole sound is in an order.\n\nSuppose there is a pigeon, suppose there is.\n\nLooseness, why is there a shadow in a kitchen, there is a shadow in a\nkitchen because every little thing is bigger.\n\nThe time when there are four choices and there are four choices in a\ndifference, the time when there are four choices there is a kind and\nthere is a kind.
